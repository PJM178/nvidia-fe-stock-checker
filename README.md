Very simple static site web app to check whether Nvidia Founders Edition cards are in stock on the official Nvidia store page. Inspired by the RTX 5000 series launch and https://github.com/jlplenio/notify-fe.

- Periodically poll the Nvidia store api
- Multiple country stores - currently: Finland and Germany
- WIP feature list: ask for permission to send notifications from the browser, select the cards you wish to poll, maybe similarly to the source of inspiration app send a sound notification, maybe flash the title of the tab to bring attention, something else?
